A personal loan is paid back to the lender over a set period of time. Fill out the form and see just how much money you can borrow from the comfort of your own home. It's as easy as that!</div>

                    <div class="p">Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a nominal yearly rate. It relates to the amount and timing of value received by the consumer to the amount and timing of payments made. 365FastLoans cannot guarantee any APR since we are not a lender ourselves. An APR can generally run between 5.99% up to 35.99%. Loan products general have a 61-day minimum repayment term and a 72-month maximum repayment term. Before accepting a loan from a lender within our network, please read the loan agreement carefully as the APR and repayment terms may differ from what is listed on this site.</div>

                    <div class="p">Repayment on personal loans is generally performed either monthly or once every two weeks, depending either on your preferences or your lender's or lending partner’s terms. You may be able to have funds withdrawn automatically from your bank account on the date agreed upon with your lender or lending partner. Be sure that you read and fully understand all policies regarding repayment and understand what you will have to do as a borrower to repay the loan. Your loan cannot be conditioned upon repayment by electronic funds transfer or automatic withdrawal. Consult your lender or lending partner for more details.</div>

Other factors that matter are the amount of money that is borrowed, the period of time of the loan and the specific interest rates used. Your credit score may also be taken into consideration.</div>
